# Stock-market-prediction Comparison of Different Algorithms


I have taken the past prices of the Tesla stock from the NASDAQ website. You can directly download the CSV file from this link.
"https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/historical"

Dependencies: 
Pandas — to read the CSV file
Numpy — perform calculations on data
Scikit learn — build the predictive models
Matplotlib — visualise the output


A linear regression model, support vector machine, random forest regressor and a gradient boosting regressor are chosen to be compared.
The training data is given to all four of the models and then we pass the testing data and obtain the predicted values for each 
model which we use to plot and visualise.
